# NASA Asteroid Classification and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R

In this project, we conducted simple data cleaning and exploration and then moved on to statistical tests, correlations, permutation tests, best subsets regression, and binary logistic regression all using R. While this was the final project for S&DS 230/530: Data Exploration and Analysis at Yale, we were given the opportunity to select any dataset we wished to.m We chose the asteroid dataset because we were especially interested in what factors correlate with an asteroid being deemed 'Hazardous.' As mere earthlings, rarely do we afford the time of thinking or worrying about a potential asteroid hitting us, yet exploring this dataset reminded us that living on Earth is in a sense, a big bubble, and that there are bigger, faster, more dangerous but more fascinating things outside of us.
